# STING-Greenhouse-Light-Management-System
STING helps ensure plants in a greenhouse that need a certain level of light for growth 24/7 to get all the light they need!

## Story
Inspiration
Inspired by the Lord of the Rings, we named our team STING, the shortsword made by elves that helps Bilbo detect the approaching of Orcs, the embodiment of darkness. It grows blue when Orcs get close to it and thus alarm the blade holder about the upcoming danger.

Our real life utilization of the device, not unlike the situation in the Lord of the Rings, is to detect the circumstance when it gets dark, only this time in a greenhouse, such as during cloudy days and after the fall of night, and to notify the staffs about the circumstance.

## Overview
This device is implemented as an alarm in the greenhouse, where the plants need exposure to light 24/7. It can keep track of the intensity of natural sunlight, which, when below a certain level that the plants need to grow, will trigger the alarm to ring a song and blink an LED light to notify people about the lack of light. This way, the staffs will realize the insufficiency of the natural light and manually turn on the laboratory lighting system to keep an adequate level of light in the greenhouse.

## How we make it?
The alert system consists of four main modules - a light sensor, a buzzer, an LED, and the four-digital display.
